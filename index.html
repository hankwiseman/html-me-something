        <h1>England</h1>

        <p class="England"> I traveled to London in 2016 as part of a backpacking trip across Europe. The highlight of my visit was the Winston Churchill museum contained in a WW2 bombshelter. Several other sites that I visted were Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, and the Natural History Museum. Make sure to watch out for cars on the wrong side of the street. </p>
        <h1>Netherlands </h1>
        <img src="images/Netherlands.jpg" height="500" width="800">
        <p> I traveled to the Netherlands in 2016 as part of a backpacking trip across Europe. The highlights of my visit were the Rembrant &amp; Banksy art exhibits. Most people travel by bike in Amsterdam and the paved path is their lane. They don't stop for pedestrians so watch out! There is also more canals in Amsterdam than in Venice! Make sure to stop at the Anne Franke musuem. </p>
        <h1> South Korea </h1>
        <img src="images/South_Korea.jpg" height="500" width="800">
        <p> I traveled to South Korean in 2015 and 2016 as part of my job. The highlights of my visits were the food. Kimchi is delicious! Most of Korea is fairly rural outside of Seoul and English is not widely spoken outside of the capital city. Inside of Seoul there is plenty to do! Seoul tower is a great hike and has a wonderful view of the city. </p>
